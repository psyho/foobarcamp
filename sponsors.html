      <h2>The Conference</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">FooBarCamp</a> is a one day conference that will take place on the 7th of December 2012 in Kraków and is directed towards experienced, local software developers. We expect about 60 attendees with varying backgrounds - but mostly Java, C#, Ruby and Python developers.</p>

<p>Most of the conference will be held in Open Space format, which is optimized towards free exchange of experiences and ideas through discussion. In addition we plan to begin with a small number of short presentations to give the attendees more topics to talk about.</p>

<h2>The Organizers</h2>

<p>FooBarCamp is organized by <a href="http://wawelhill.com">Wawel Hill sp. z o.o.</a> in cooperation with <a href="http://sckrk.com">Software Craftsmanship Kraków group (SCKRK)</a>.
