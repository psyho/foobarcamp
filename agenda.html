      <h2>All you need is talk. Talk is all you need.</h2>
<p>
  No, seriously. Here are some example topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Best practices in isolated tests in Rails.</li>
  <li>Will functional programming overcome object oriented?</li>
  <li>How to sneak a new programming language into a project without the manager knowing it?</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some topics already submitted by attendees:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Paul Klipp:</b> Kanban in practice</li>
  <li><b>Damian Łukasik:</b> Continuous performance monitoring in production</li>
  <li><b>Piotr Leszczyński:</b><br>
  I'm deeply concerned about process management, improving the process, changing it, experimenting. Currently I've been working with Kanban in my team for 3 years. I've been using Personal Kanban for 1 year in my office. Recently I've started using Personal Kanban with my wife.
  I would gladly talk about things connected with improving our day-to-day work, especialy in our private life. Do we improve? How do we improve? What do we change and why? How do we measure the improvement? </li>
  <li><b>Wiktor Żołnowski:</b> Reversed tests piramid</li>
  <li><b>Adam Pohorecki:</b><br>
  Over a couple of years of experimenting with design, I arrived at a pattern, that most objects in the systems I write have just one public method that has some logic, or are pure value types. Ever since I started playing with Clojure I feel that the (well designed) functional languages offer significant benefits over regular OO languages like Ruby or Python and fit my way of thinking better. I would like to discuss the future of programming languages, and whether it is functional.</li>
  <li><b>Adam Pohorecki:</b> Ping-Pong Pomodoro Pair Programming</li>
  <li><b>Paweł Pierzchała:</b><br>
  Anyone knows contract tests? How to make automated contract verification useful?</li>
</ul>
